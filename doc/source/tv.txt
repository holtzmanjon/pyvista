TV module
*********

Introduction
++++++++++++

tv is a simple package to provide an enhanced image display tool built on
top of the basic functionality of a matplotlib figure. The tv tool is
an object that displays images and also allows the user to get input
from the display.

It can take as input either a numpy array or a FITS HDU object (e.g., from
astropy.io.fits), and will display it in the window. Pixel and value readout
is provided. Normal matplotlib options/buttons (zoom/pan) are available.
For FITS input, WCS as well as pixel locations are given, as is the OBJECT
information. 

Four images are stored internally, allowing for rapid cycling (blinking)
between them using the '-' and '+/=' keys.

A method is provided to allow the user to retrieve the location of a keystroke
event in the window along with the key that was pressed.

Installation
++++++++++++

The package requires autopy to be installed (available via pip). For Mac OS X,
this requires libpng

The tv package is available at http://github.com/holtzmanjon/tv
