SKYCALC module
**************

Introduction
++++++++++++

skycalc is a module that mostly provides an interface to
the astroplan package for observations planning. It has
a table() routine that emulates the hour angle listing of
John Thorstensen's skycalc program. It also contains a 
simple routine for returning airmass from an image header
(allowing for different ways of storing it), as well as
a routine for returning parallactic angle
