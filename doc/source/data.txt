Dataclass module
****************

The dataclass module defines a Data class which is very similar to
astropy CCDData and uses much of the astropy code, but defines a class
that can also include wavelength, response, and sky attributes. We also add a bitmask
attribute that is an integer rather than a boolean to allow it to be
used as a bitmask (see :ref:`bitmask`).  We also remove the requirement
of including units. Finally, the name CCDData is not used, since we may
be using digital data that may not come from a CCD!

Unfortunately, without redoing nddata, the methods provided by nddata, such
as slicing and arithmetic, drop the new attributes. So beware
using those! Internally in pyvista, uncertainties are propagated in the 
code rather than using the nddata functions.

The Data class includes a write() method to write all of the different
attributes to different extentsions in a FITS file. The read() method 
will read FITS files with these multiple extensions and populate the
attributes of a Data object.
