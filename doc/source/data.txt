Dataclass module
****************

Here we define a Data class which is very similar to astropy CCDData and uses
much of the astropy code, but defines a class that can also include a wavelength
extension. We also add a bitmask attribute that is an integer rather than
a boolean to allow it to be used as a bitmask (see `bitmask module`_). We also remove the requirement
of including units. Finally, the name CCDData is not used, since we may 
be using digital data that may not come from a CCD!

Unfortunately, without redoing nddata, the methods provided by nddata, such
as slicing and arithmetic, seem to drop the new attributes. So beware
using those!
