ETC module
**********

Introduction
++++++++++++

etc is a module with tools for exposure time calculation.

It allows a user to set up Object, Atmosphere, Telescope,
Instrument, and Observation objects, and then use the
latter to calculate the flux from an object, an exposure time 
given a desired S/N, or S/N given an exposure time.

etc works in both a spectral mode, giving S/N per pixel
(given a dispersion), and also an imaging mode, in which
the spectrum is integrated over.

Usage
+++++

The user instatiates Object, Atmosphere, Telescope, and
Instrument objects. 

The Object object specifies a magnitude and SED.

The Atmosphere object specifies a moon phase. Emission
spectra are taken from the ESO sky calculator for moon
phase (to the closest 0.1). 

The Telescope object takes a telescope name or a
diameter.

The Instrument object takes an instrument name or a
single, wavelength-independent throughput.

These are then passed when an
Observation object is instatiated.
