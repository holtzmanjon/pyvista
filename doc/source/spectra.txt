SPECTRA module
**************

spectra is a module that implements some classes/tools for handling
basic spectral data reduction: extraction of spectra and wavelength calibration.
The routines allow fo both longslit data, echelle data, and a
combination (multiple orders with longslit, or multiple slitlets).

Data are read and processed using NDData structures, which carry along both 
the image data and an associated uncertainty array.

The routines are implemented with two basic classes:

spectra.Trace :

spectra.Wavecal : 

In more detail:
