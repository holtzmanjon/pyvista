Welcome to pyvista's documentation!
===================================

pyvista is Python package that provides image display, and some image processing and 
analysis tools for a versatile quick analysis environment for working
with astronomical data (imaging and spectroscopy). The goal is to provide
a convenient framework that is relatively straightforward to understand and
to use that allows for both performing data processing efficiently but also
has options that may be useful pedagogically.

The initial algorithms are relatively simple, but might be extended over
time by interested users.

The project is hosted on github. See the Installation page for how to download
and set up.
