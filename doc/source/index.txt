Welcome to pyvista's documentation!
===================================

pyvista is Python package that provides image display, and some image processing and 
analysis tools for a versatile quick analysis environment for working
with astronomical data (imaging and spectroscopy). The goal is to provide
a convenient framework that is relatively straightforward to understand and
to use that allows for both performing data processing efficiently but also
has options that may be useful pedagogically.

The initial algorithms are relatively simple, but might be extended over
time by interested users. pyvista does use routines from other packages
including astropy, astroplan, and photutils.

The project is hosted on github, and will be available via pip as stability
is achieved. See the Installation page for how to download and set up.

The name pyvista was adopted because it shares some history and a tiny bit of
look-and-feel with the VISTA package developed during the 1980s at
the University of California by Richard Stover, Tod Lauer, Don
Terndrup, and others. The original VISTA was written in Fortran for
a VAX/VMS system.  It was ported to Unix/X11 by Jon Holtzman, with
X11 display routines largely developed by John Tonry, and distributed
as xvista. But pyvista has no code in common with previous versions!
