REDUCE module
*************

reduce is a module that implements basic data reduction for imaging
and spectroscopic data. It works by reading a configuration file that
contains blocks of information needed to reduce a set of data for
a given instrument in a given night; multiple blocks can be specified
in a single input configuration file if desired. It can be run in an
interactive mode where the user sees the results of each step and can make some
modification, and also in a batch mode where the processing proceeds
automatically.

The reduction is run using the reduce.reduce() routine where a configuration
file is a required input. Optional inputs control
the amount of user interaction: the plot= option allows the user to specify
a matplotlib figure in which some data are displayed, and the display= option
allows the user to specify a pyvista.tv.TV() instance into which image
data are displayed. A verbose= option allows the user to control the
level of output.

The configuration file provides an instrument identification, which
is used to read an instrument configuration file with basic information
such as overscan region, gain, readout noise, normalization region, etc.
It then contains blocks of information used for the calibration 
(superbias, superdark, superflat, wavelength calibration), which can either
specify existing calibration products, or a list of frames to be used
to construct new calibration products. Multiple calibration products of
a given type can be constructed and each is given a label by which it can
be referenced for use in reduction. Finally, blocks of information are
given for the object frames to reduce.

The configuration file is formatted as a YAML file, which is a simply
and natural way to provide the required information. There is some required
information in the file, and some optional information. A complete list
is provided below.
