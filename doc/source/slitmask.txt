SLITMASK module
***************

*slitmask is only in earliest stages of development*

slitmask is the pyvista module that implements routines for dealing with slit
masks.

Several routines are provided to facilitate getting objects into slitlets
based on an image of the mask and an image of the field: findholes() finds
the location of holes on a slitmask flat field image, findstars() finds
stars on an image, and fit() solves for the translation and rotation to
put the stars into the holes.

Even more in development, findslits() attempts to find the slitlets in a
spectroscopic image.
